# Landing-Page

This is a project to try out my HTML and CSS knowledge after competeing Foundations of HTML and CSS in The Odin Project. It will be the first page in this course to build from scratch.
The asignment is to build a simple landing page with some text, buttons and images. It is a good way to show what I learned about for example Flexboks and structuring HTML. The instructions and reference is very clear and I am confident (but not too much :D ) that I will be ok.
